*Wonderous Item, very rare*
## Description
---
A rotating file device used to store information on the visitors and residents of [[Rahenor]]. Those entering the main city via the Pith are required to give their name and reason for entering the city to be allowed to enter. Notes about information given and what can be observed are often also noted down. Other information such as residents' addresses, criminals whereabouts, and more can also be found in this rolodex, although more detailed records are located in the city's archives.

## Mechanics
---
On a successful slight of hand check or a successful investigation check, the holder of the rolodex can take 10 minutes to search for names on the cards to glean information about their target.

*Armor (Medium), rare*
## Description
---
Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers. On the right breast, the metal rings are colored a dark red in the shape of two fangs.

## Mechanics
---
This chain mail grants the wearer +1 AC and doffs itself instantly when there is a vampire within 30 feet of the wearer.

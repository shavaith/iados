*Wonderous Item, uncommon*
## Description
---
A leather bag with 12 lime-colored seeds in it, accompanied by a piece of folded parchment with a drawing depicting placing a seed in an arm wound that leads to a drawing of a scab on the arm where the wound was.*

## Mechanics
---
Placing a seed inside an open wound results in a dark brown bark rapidly growing over and in the wound. This heals the target for 1d8+CHA of the person applying the seed. The target is considered "undead" until their next long rest is over.

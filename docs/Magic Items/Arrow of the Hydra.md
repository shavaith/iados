*Weapon (arrow), very rare*
## Description
---
A single-use arrow tipped with a sharp hydra's tooth.

## Mechanics
---
On a hit, the arrow deals an extra 2d6 poison damage. On a miss, the arrow lands in a square selected by the DM, within 30 feet of your intended target. At the start of the next round, an undead skeleton claws of the ground in that square. The skeleton acts on its own initiative and attacks the nearest living creature until reduced to 0 hit points.

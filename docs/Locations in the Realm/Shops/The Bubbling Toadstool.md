## Overview
---
The Bubbling Toadstool is an apothecary within [[Rahenor]] proper. To access it, the route requires taking the [[Rahenor#^The Pith|Pith]] up to the city proper, out onto the branches and down several rounds of stairs to get to the small shop the hangs in the lower branches of the [[Rahenor#^The Canopy|Canopy]].

The owner of the Bubbling Toadstool is [[Daenalis Talphesco]]. The shop is frequently supplied by mushrooms and herbs from [[Levana Quinn]] and her pet mimic, [[Levana Quinn#^283e9c|Darryl]].

### Muroosa Balm: 100 GP

### Olisuba Leaves: 50 GP each
These dried leaves of the Olisuba tree, when steeped to make a tea, can help a body recover from strenuous activity. If you drink a dose of Olisuba tea during a long rest, your exhaustion level is reduced by 2 instead of 1 at the end of that long rest.

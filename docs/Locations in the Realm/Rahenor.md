- Lothar
	- Since Lothar claimed he was in Rahenor to sell mushrooms, he was noted as "mushroom dude" by the Guard of the Grove at the Pith when he entered. He was also noted as "human".
	- He later used the [[Rahenor Resident Rolodex]] to modify notes about himself, erasing the quotes around "human" and adding that he is a "confidential informant of the chief of the Guard" (referring to Captain Nesterin Elfin) and to "handle with respect".
- Nitten Amai
	- claimed he was in Rahenor to visit someone named Carly and was interested in the moon. Noted as a "rock gnome".
- Neroon Greatmane
	- As he introduced himself with a spiel about his Goddess, Selune, and was thus dubbed as a "moon nerd".

*Wonderous Item, uncommon*
## Description

This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds, whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken.

## Mechanics
---
You can use an action and name on liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out at a rate of up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum liquid the jar can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't make a different one or more past its maximum until the next dawn.

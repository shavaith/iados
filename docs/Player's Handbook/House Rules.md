House Rules are things that Shelbi has instituted into gameplay to make the experience more enjoyable, balanced, or story-driven. You'll find a myriad of House Rules have been:
- carried over or brought in based on other games Shelbi has played
- things she had read online to enhance the table-top role-playing experience

If you find that there is a rule that needs to be house'd, talk it over with Shelbi to figure out the appropriate dimensioning.

## Snacks for Re-Roll
---
If a player brings a snack to share with the group, they will get a re-roll. This is **not** taking the best of two rolls ([[Definitions#^3472c5|inspiration]]), but rather **replacing** the original roll with a new one--for better or for worse.

## Inspiration for Inspiration
---
If a player makes a timely, funny joke that makes the DM laugh during a session, the DM may grant inspiration.

## Additional Feats
---
Players are allowed to take additional feats any time after Level 4. However, to ensure both adequate storytelling hooks and fairness, the DM will work with you to also gain a [[House Rules#Detriments|detriment]].

## Detriments
---
[[Detriments]] are the downside of taking additional feats past Level 4. The _yin_ to the additional feats' _yang_, detriments serve as a story-driven balance that can affect players in and out of combat as their feat does. These are crafted by the DM and the player in question together to ensure fairness.

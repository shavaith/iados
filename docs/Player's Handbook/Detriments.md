## Overview
---
Detriments are the downside of taking additional feats past Level 4. The _yin_ to the additional feats' _yang_, detriments serve as a story-driven balance that can affect players in and out of combat as their feat does. These are crafted by the DM and the player in question together to ensure fairness. Iadosian detriments in use are listed below.

>[!question]- How do I take an additional feat?
> Just talk to your DM about it after you have reached Level 4 or higher. She will be able to work with you in creating an appropriate, story-driven detriment so you aren't overpowered.

## Iadosian Detriments

### Fade Away
The side effects have begun to manifest in strange and uncontrollable ways.
- Your Intelligence increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Immediately after being struck, roll 1d12 interaction die.
- On a 1, you disappear from view, dropping your weapon. You are unable to act except to move until you pass a DC 12 INT saving throw.
- If you are bloodied or if the blow makes you bloodied, this effect occurs on a 1, 2, or 3.

### Trigger Happy
With adrenaline rushing during the opening of combat, your hands twitch just a little too quickly and your weapon fire before you can properly aim -- hitting either the ground, yourself, or close allies.

If you are in the first 3 slots of initiative order, **at the start of each of your turns**, roll 1d20:
- On a 3, your weapon misfires but misses, not harming any creature but leaving you with one less attack action per turn.
- On a 2, your weapon misfires into your own foot, dealing your standard damage roll and leaving you with one less attack action per turn.
- On a 1, your weapon misfires into an ally within either 5 feet of you or 5 feet of your intended target; if there is no ally in either of those places, it misfires into the ground or air.

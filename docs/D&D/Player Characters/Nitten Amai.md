## Vignette
---
*Nitten has lived a rough life. For as long as he can remember Nitten has been ridiculed, ostracized, and even hunted because of his size and his ability for wanton destruction -- intentional or otherwise. He did his best to hide from people, keeping mostly to the woods but he often sat on the nearby hills and watched the townsfolk from afar, wishing he could experience their life. It was a kind soul that reached out to the small gnome and changed his life. This stranger helped Nitten get acclimated to indoor life. Nitten was slowly but surely able to integrate into the city lifestyle and -- with some help -- was able to become the person he wanted to be.*

## Physical Appearance
---
Nitten is a well-built rock gnome with tan and weathered skin. He stands at 4-feet-2-inches tall with a tuft of brown hair in the middle of an otherwise bald head. His eyes are grey with flecks of blue in them and they are often seem lighting up with enthusiasm at the potential of destroying things. He wears modest clothes that seem to be scraps of whatever he could find, and he doesn't wear shoes.

## Personality
---
Nitten is a soft soul with a penchant for destruction. He is often seen running into battle headlong, not caring is his friends are close behind. He seems to thrive in battle, using his axe or a makeshift weapon (such as chairs) to get the job done. He often act very child-like, asking many questions or drawing pictures or spilling a variety of liquids everywhere from his [[Alchemy Jug]].

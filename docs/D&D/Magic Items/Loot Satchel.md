*Wonderous Item, very rare*
## Description
---
*A small pouch that seems to change appearance based on the current holder. It can hold many items and have items drawn from within it, although it is currently unknown where is it storing items put into it or pulling items from.*

## Mechanics
---
The holder of the satchel can think of an object while reaching into the sack. Depending on the clarity of the item they are imaging, they can make a sleight of hand check to pull that object out of the bag. The further they are from a successful roll, the further the item strays from their original idea.
